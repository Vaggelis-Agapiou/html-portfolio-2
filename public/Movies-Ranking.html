        <h1>Best Movies According to Vaggelis</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
        <hr/>
        
        <h3>Akira</h3>
        <p>It is just mind boggling to me how they made such clear and articulate animations drawn just by hand in 1988, accompanied by a great action packed story.</p>
        
        <h3>The Lighthouse</h3>
        <p>A great and grim story based on the Character of Prometheus, who brought the fire to the humans against the will of the Gods.</p>
       
        <h3>Enter the Void</h3>
        <p>A jaw-dropping movie, that dwelves on what someone experiences at the moment of their own death.</p>
